# Codeboard

- Introduces system/application composer role on software development teams and emphasizes code re-use. This role assembles systems (or applications) from blocks delivered by programmers. The role can request revisions on blocks (with instructions in a comment), 

- This type of IDE can help non-development teams leverage the automation potential of programming without needing to learn programming language syntax. Instead, systems and applications can be planned in terms of block-level functionality at a natural level of abstraction. The blocks are then added to a backlock of work organized into a kanban style board that programmers can assign and deliver. The system composer sees if there's an update available and can then update the block where it's used in the system or application. In other words, DSLs can be defined and used to specify systems by system designers while they're implemented in parallel by software developers.
